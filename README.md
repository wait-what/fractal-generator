# Fractal generator
This generates some fractal I don't know the name of.

![6 iterations](./assets/6_iterations.png "6 iterations")

## Running
- `cargo run --release 6` 
  - Replace 6 with the wanted iteration count, anything over 9 is probably going to crash
- Image will be saved as `output.png`

## Know more than me?
Please tell me by opening an issue.
